Level 99 fix

Level 99 fix for Seth

Tornado Dagger name fix in battle

Fixed stats not updating right after level up

Vision now uses the Mental stat of the caster rather than a set value

Changed the Shadow Blade data so the underflow will no longer happen with Chaz before level 4

Now Chaz is revived after the battle against Zio to prevent a Game Over if Chaz, Rika and Rune are dead

Fixed missing palette cycling in the Air Castle

Fixed Wren usage number for Posibolt at level 91

Stats are now updated when Chaz equips the Elsydeon

When you grab the Canceller and the rings in the Rykross towers, if you open the menu immediately after opening the chests, the event flags needed to trigger the second Le Roof cutscene won't be set. This patch makes sure the flags will always be set.
